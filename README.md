🍕 Pizza Runner SQL Case Study – Part A: Pizza Metrics
This project is part of the famous 8 Week SQL Challenge by Danny Ma.
I solved Part A: Pizza Metrics to practice real-world SQL queries and strengthen my data analytics skills.

📌 Case Study Background
Danny launched Pizza Runner, a startup where runners deliver fresh pizzas.
The goal of this case study is to analyze customer orders, runners, and pizza details using SQL queries.

6.What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?

7.For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?

8.How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?

9.What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?

10.What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?
