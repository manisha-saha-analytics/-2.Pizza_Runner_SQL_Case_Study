# 🍕 Pizza Runner SQL Case Study – Full Solutions (Part A, B & C)

This project is part of the famous **[8 Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/)** by Danny Ma.  
I worked on **Pizza Runner Case Study**, solving SQL queries step by step.

---

## 📌 Case Study Background  
Danny launched **Pizza Runner**, a startup where runners deliver fresh pizzas.  

Using SQL, I explored different business problems:  
- **Part A: Pizza Metrics** → Analyzing basic order & customer data  
- **Part B: Runner & Customer Experience** → Evaluating runner performance and delivery times  
- **Part C: Ingredient Optimisation** → Finding insights on popular ingredients, exclusions & extras  
- **Part D: Pricing & Ratings** → Estimating pizza prices, calculating revenue & customer ratings

## 📝 Parts Completed  

### ✅ Part A: Pizza Metrics
- How many pizzas were ordered?  
- How many unique customer orders were made?  
- How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?  
- How many of each type of pizza was delivered?  
- … (total 10 questions solved)

### ✅ Part B: Runner and Customer Experience
- How many runners signed up each week?  
- How many successful deliveries were made by each runner?  
- What was the average time it took for each runner to pickup the order?
